This project was a great learning opportunity in both understanding how to develop a website whose design furthers its purpose as well as advancing my skills technically. Using the Three.js library, I was able to incorporate 3D models of each of the plants I cataloged, which was a great learning experience and also provided a nuanced visual element."}

            description={"To practice API calls, I used the coolor.io API to generate a random color palette that is then applied to the gnome graphic to the right. In order to replace the colors, I iterated through each pixel of the image, cheked if it match the old color, and then replaced it with the new color generated from the color palette. The API outputs five colors, which change the gnome's hat, shirt, mittens, pompom, and shoes individually. This was a very challening assignment for me, but I learned a lot about APIs, using canvas in HTML, for loops, and got lots of practice debugging using console.log and developer tools."}
